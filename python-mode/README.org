* Introduction

  This is a home-brew python-mode with some excerpts from GNU/Emacs'
  python.el.

  It aims to provide the stuff you'll expect from a major mode for
  python editing while keeping it simple.

  Currently it implements:
   + Syntax highlighting
   + Solid (auto)indentation support
   + auto-detection of indentation levels for current file
   + Triple quoted strings support (stolen without guilt from
     GNU/Emacs' original python.el)
   + Fancy variable assignment colorization
   + Movement commands you'll expect from a major-mode.
   + Python shell integration (not only for Python 2 but also Python 3!)
   + Python shell completion (Same as above!)
   + PDB Tracking (it even supports ipdb!)
   + Symbol completion that sucks because a running inferior shell
     process and valid code in the current buffer are needed (Don't
     blame me, it's like that in every python-mode I know). Notice I
     don't recommend this thing, use ropemacs instead
   + Eldoc support (this suffers the same drawbacks as the symbol
     completion, but it's the only sane way to do it from Elisp)
   + add-log-current-defun support
   + hideshow support
   + outline support
   + fill paragraph

  The code is well organized in parts with some clean sensitive
  naming. While I did the best effort to keep the code as clean as
  possible it might be you find some parts that sucks and that's OK
  since I'm not an Elisp guru. Please ping me or fill a ticket when
  that happens, could be a nice learning experience.

* Requirements

  This package was tested with GNU/Emacs 23 only, it should work with
  others versions too but I can't ensure anything. Besides from that
  nothing else is required.

* Installation/Usage

  Add this to your .emacs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
  (require 'python)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  *M-x describe-mode* when editing a python file should be enough to
  get some good overview about what this major-mode is all about :)

* Bug Reports

  If you find a bug please report it sending an email listed in the
  top of the file or just use the github tracker.

* License

  python.el is free software under the GPL v3, see LICENSE file for
  details.
